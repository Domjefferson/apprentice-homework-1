# Homework 1 - Maths, Strings and Boolean Operations 

Welcome to homework 1. The purpose of this homework is to test your knowledge of Python maths operations, string operations and boolean logic. There are three sections for each topic with answers increasing in difficulty in each. Please continue to read this document for the questions and complete your answers inside the relevent answer file. You can then save these files and commit them to your fork of this repository (hint: we'll be using git a little bit too so I've covered this a little bit at tthe start!).

## Using Git

1. First you will want to fork this repository on GitHub so you can commit your answers to it. You can click the "Fork" button above this file to the right.

2. Next, you'll want to "clone" the repository from GitHub to your laptop so you make changes. You can do this by running: `git clone https://github.com/username/reponame` in a terminal.

3. Make some changes, like completing a task or two.

4. When you've completed the task you'll want to commit your changes by running `git commit -a -m "A message describing the change you've made"`

5. Push the changes back to GitHub: `git push origin master`

## Part 1 - Maths

In this section, you'll be tested on your knowledge of basic maths operations in Python.

### Task 1: Basic Math
 1. Write a function that takes two numbers and adds them together
 2. Write a function that multiplies two numbers

### Task 2: Python 'math' library
 1. Write a function that returns the square root of a number (Bonus: Validate the input so the program doesn't error when inputting 0).

----------------------------------------

## Part 2 - Strings

This section will test your knowledge on strings and some operations you can perform on them using the Python standard library

### Task 3: Putting it together

Write a function that takes two numbers and one of the following strings: ["add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide"] and calculates the result of the operation.

----------------------------------------

## Part 3 - Boolean Operations


----------------------------------------

## Part 4 - Putting it all together!


### n. Write a Python program to test whether a number is within 100 of 1000 or 2000.
